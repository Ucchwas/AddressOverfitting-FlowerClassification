# AddressOverfitting-FlowerClassification

Here I build a CNN to classify flower images. I also see how our model overfits and how overfitting can be addressed using data augmentation. Data augmentation is a process of generating new training samples from current training dataset using transformations such as zoom, rotations, change in contrast etc.
